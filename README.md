Hi there! 

If you are seeing this, it is probably because you are interviewing for a developper position at LS GROUP. It also means that you are a top profile, as we usually keep a shortlist of 2 to 3 persons at this step. :sparkler: You rock! :sparkler:

Our goal now is to assess your technical level. We will have another interview after this test to provide feedback and tips so we can hopefully both learn something valuable.

## Rules

- Any comments, code, questions should be in English.
- You can use any resources you want!
- Don't stay stuck if something is unclear. You are very welcome to ask question to your contact at LS GROUP.
- Don't have the computer to do this? Need more time? Tell us and we will find an arrangement.
- This repository is your playground. Feel free to experiment, push code, propose modifications.
- You can modify any code provided.
- If this test seems like a waste of time for you, we might be able to skip this step if you provide relevant Github, recommendations, etc.
- This test should not take more than two hours, including the time to install all the required softwares. If this is taking you way more time, maybe you are overthinking this; keep it easy!
- This project was made with Unity 2021.3, but you can use another Unity version if you prefer to.

## Let's go!
### Clone the project

> Use your favorite git client to clone this project on your computer.

You might need to create the appropriate account and setup ssh keys accordingly.
Open it in Unity. 
Congrats, you are on the right track! :rocket:

### Let's code

This test is in 3 steps.

Do you see the small planet in scene ? This is where stuff gonna take place. If you press play, you'll see that cubes are spawned on the surface.

First step we need a controller to be able to move a player on the surface of the planet. You can consider a constant radius for the planet. 
The player already exists but you'll see that the controller misses a few things. Movement should use the keyboard : up and down for movement forward and backward, left and right for a local rotation on the camera's transform (cf gif below).

Once you'll have those cubes/rocks spawned and your player moving you'll have to add behaviours to it.
For the second step we want to color each cube in black when they are at the left of your player, and color each cube in white when they are on the right side. We only consider cube center position.
There are a lot of ways to achieve this : You are free to use your preferred method.

Last step, there is an HUD on the top right corner. You'll need to make it work without a direct reference.

You should obtain something like that.

Happy with the result? 

> Commit it using git and push it to this repository. 

Don't hesitate to send an email when you are done so we can check your project and plan the next interview meeting.

:tada: You are done! Thanks a lot for your time :tada:
